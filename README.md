## Important Note

⚠️ **Java Applets No Longer Supported**: Modern web browsers have discontinued support for Java applets for security reasons. The interactive Java applets in this demonstration will not run in current browsers. The educational text and explanations remain valuable, but the interactive components require either:
- An older browser with Java plugin support (not recommended for security reasons)
- Converting the applets to modern web technologies (JavaScript/HTML5 Canvas)
- Running the applets in a standalone Java application
